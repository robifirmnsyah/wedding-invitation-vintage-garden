# Implementation Plan — Vintage Garden Editorial

> Scope: planning only. This document deliberately does not modify application source code. Implementation must preserve business logic, APIs, Supabase, RSVP, wishes, gifts, QRIS, maps, guest personalization, and admin dashboard.

## Design-system dependencies

- Source of truth: `design-system/MASTER.md`.
- Usage and review rules: `design-system/README.md`.
- Existing stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion/GSAP/Lenis where already present.
- Couple identity: **Robi & Tiara**.
- Palette: olive, sage, ivory, beige, with restrained muted gold.

## Work sequencing

Implement one vertical slice at a time: global foundation → opening/hero → content chapters → interactive forms/modals → performance polish. After every slice, run type-check, build, and responsive browser checks at 375px, 768px, 1024px, and 1440px. Keep each slice independently reversible.

## P0 — Foundation and opening experience

### P0.1 Loading experience

- **Current problem:** Loading and asset readiness are not yet governed by a documented editorial experience; heavy media can create uncertainty or layout shift.
- **Desired outcome:** A calm, minimal loading state that establishes the garden/editorial tone and exits once critical hero content is ready.
- **Files to change:** Existing loading component/route discovered during implementation; `src/app/globals.css`; relevant asset manifest only if needed.
- **Required assets:** Optimized hero image, small botanical mark, optional muted-gold hairline.
- **Technical approach:** Reserve hero dimensions; use Next/Image; preload only the LCP image; lazy-load below-fold media.
- **Animation:** One opacity/scale reveal, 200–400ms; no continuous petals or spinner-heavy motion.
- **Mobile:** Keep loading content within the first viewport and avoid blocking scroll longer than necessary.
- **Desktop:** Preserve the same short sequence with a wider editorial frame.
- **Accessibility:** Announce meaningful loading only when necessary; never trap keyboard focus; provide readable fallback text.
- **Performance:** Target LCP under 2.5s on a simulated mobile connection; no full-resolution source image.
- **Regression risks:** Hydration mismatch, flash of incorrect font, delayed interaction.
- **Acceptance criteria:** No visible layout jump; opening becomes usable after critical hero assets load; reduced-motion skips decorative transitions.
- **Verification:** Playwright/browser check with cache disabled and reduced-motion enabled.

### P0.2 Hero / cover

- **Current problem:** Hero is visually playful and does not yet establish the intended Vintage Garden Editorial hierarchy.
- **Desired outcome:** Photography-led cover with Robi & Tiara, editorial serif typography, botanical engraving support, and a clear opening CTA.
- **Files to change:** Existing hero section/component, global tokens, image configuration only after implementation approval.
- **Required assets:** Best couple hero image; botanical etched ornament; optimized responsive image variants.
- **Technical approach:** Full-bleed or framed image with reserved aspect ratio; deep-olive text and ivory surface; avoid fullscreen blur.
- **Animation:** Single chapter reveal: image crop settles, then title and CTA fade/translate in.
- **Mobile:** 16px minimum body text, CTA at least 44px high, no horizontal overflow, safe-area padding.
- **Desktop:** Editorial max-width frame, restrained negative space, image remains the primary narrative.
- **Accessibility:** One h1; descriptive alt text; labelled CTA; visible focus state; contrast WCAG AA.
- **Performance:** LCP image in WebP/AVIF where supported; responsive `sizes`; no eager loading for non-hero media.
- **Regression risks:** Cover interaction may affect guest personalization/open state.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Opening interaction still unlocks the invitation and preserves all existing state/business logic.
- **Verification:** Test open flow on iOS-sized and desktop viewports; inspect network and LCP.

### P0.3 Opening interaction

- **Current problem:** Opening interaction can feel like a decorative transition instead of an intentional invitation moment.
- **Desired outcome:** One clear, reversible open gesture with an obvious CTA and no hidden content dependency.
- **Files to change:** Existing invitation shell/open-state component and styles.
- **Required assets:** None beyond hero/ornament assets.
- **Technical approach:** Preserve current open state and event handlers; change only presentation and motion sequencing.
- **Animation:** 300–600ms transform/opacity chapter reveal; no continuous animation.
- **Mobile:** CTA reachable with one thumb; prevent accidental double activation; preserve scroll position.
- **Desktop:** Same semantic interaction with slightly slower editorial pacing.
- **Accessibility:** Button semantics, aria-label, keyboard activation, focus return, reduced-motion fallback.
- **Performance:** Avoid animating width/height; animate transform and opacity only.
- **Regression risks:** Breaking audio/autoplay policy or guest-specific route state.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Existing open behavior and personalization are unchanged.
- **Verification:** Keyboard, touch, refresh-before-open, deep-link, and reduced-motion tests.

### P0.4 Typography foundation

- **Current problem:** Fredoka is not aligned with the editorial direction; Arabic shaping and role separation need explicit rules.
- **Desired outcome:** Editorial serif display system, Poppins or equivalent UI/body system, and a verified Arabic font for Quranic verse.
- **Files to change:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, global CSS/Tailwind tokens, Quranic verse component only if font wiring is required.
- **Required assets:** Next.js-compatible font imports or self-hosted subsets; Arabic font with shaping support.
- **Technical approach:** Use `next/font`; define font roles and CSS variables; avoid layout shifts from late font loading.
- **Animation:** None in typography foundation.
- **Mobile:** Body 16px minimum; metadata 14px minimum; readable line-height.
- **Desktop:** Fluid display scale capped at editorial max size.
- **Accessibility:** Preserve text zoom; do not use text as image; verify Arabic direction and shaping.
- **Performance:** Subset latin/arabic ranges; preload only display/body fonts that are above fold.
- **Regression risks:** Font metrics alter wrapping and hero height.
- **Acceptance criteria:** No clipped names or Quranic glyphs at 200% zoom.
- **Verification:** Visual diff at four breakpoints, Arabic shaping check, Lighthouse font audit.

### P0.5 Global tokens

- **Current problem:** Visual rules are distributed across raw classes and need one implementation mapping.
- **Desired outcome:** Tokens from `MASTER.md` become the only source for color, spacing, type, radius, shadow, and motion.
- **Files to change:** `src/app/globals.css`, Tailwind config, design-token helper if present.
- **Required assets:** None.
- **Technical approach:** Map semantic tokens to CSS variables and Tailwind theme aliases; avoid scattered raw hex values.
- **Animation:** Centralize duration/easing/distance tokens.
- **Mobile:** Use fluid spacing and typography where possible.
- **Desktop:** Apply content-width and section spacing tokens consistently.
- **Accessibility:** Contrast tokens must pass WCAG AA.
- **Performance:** Avoid broad expensive filters in base styles.
- **Regression risks:** Existing olive utility names may visually change many sections.
- **Acceptance criteria:** New sections can use tokens without inventing values.
- **Verification:** Token grep, contrast audit, build/type-check.

### P0.6 Accessibility foundation

- **Current problem:** Accessibility requirements need to be enforced consistently across chapters and controls.
- **Desired outcome:** Keyboard order, focus states, semantic headings, labels, alt text, and reduced motion are baseline behavior.
- **Files to change:** App shell, global CSS, shared controls, modal primitives.
- **Required assets:** None.
- **Technical approach:** Add skip/link focus patterns, semantic landmarks, `:focus-visible`, reduced-motion hook, and aria labels.
- **Animation:** Disable or shorten nonessential motion for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Mobile:** Touch targets ≥44×44px with 8px spacing.
- **Desktop:** Keyboard navigation matches visual order.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA contrast, screen-reader labels, no color-only meaning.
- **Performance:** No polling or animation loop solely for decoration.
- **Regression risks:** Focus trap changes can affect RSVP/gift modals.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Keyboard-only pass from cover through closing section.
- **Verification:** axe/Lighthouse plus manual keyboard and screen-reader smoke tests.

### P0.7 Mobile scroll behavior

- **Current problem:** Fullscreen effects, blur, and multiple simultaneous motions can make mobile scrolling heavy or disorienting.
- **Desired outcome:** Predictable chapter-based scroll with one motion gesture per viewport.
- **Files to change:** Invitation shell, scroll/motion utilities, section wrappers.
- **Required assets:** None.
- **Technical approach:** Preserve Lenis/GSAP/Framer Motion behavior only where useful; gate all with reduced-motion and mobile performance checks.
- **Animation:** Transform/opacity only; no continuous multi-element loops.
- **Mobile:** No horizontal scroll; no scroll hijacking; passive touch behavior.
- **Desktop:** Gentle section reveal and editorial pacing.
- **Accessibility:** Native scroll remains usable; reduced-motion disables smooth scrolling where appropriate.
- **Performance:** Keep animation concurrency to one primary gesture per viewport; limit blur/filter usage.
- **Regression risks:** Scroll locking can break opening, RSVP, or modal close behavior.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Native back/forward and anchor/deep-link behavior remain predictable.
- **Verification:** 375px device emulation, touch scroll, reduced-motion, low-end CPU throttle.

## P1 — Content chapters

For each P1 chapter, preserve current data/config and implement a shared editorial section wrapper: deep-olive heading, ivory/sage surface, thin muted-gold hairline, botanical ornament, and one reveal gesture. Avoid repetitive rounded cards.

- **Technical approach:** Use `next/image`, explicit dimensions, focal-point crop metadata.
- **Animation:** One image reveal per chapter; no looping petals.
- **Mobile/Desktop:** Stacked mobile portraits; balanced editorial grid desktop.
- **Accessibility:** Descriptive alt text and preserved names.
- **Performance:** Lazy-load below-fold images; AVIF/WebP outputs.
- **Regression risks:** Wrong portrait or broken config mapping.
- **Acceptance criteria:** Selected portrait documented; no source files copied into public unoptimized.
- **Verification:** Asset audit and visual crop review.

### P1.3 Love story

- **Current problem:** Repeated cards can make the story feel like a dashboard.
- **Desired outcome:** A vertical editorial timeline with breathing room and a single chapter transition.

## Asset mapping

| Section | Recommended photo filename | Orientation | Crop recommendation | Target dimensions | Output format | Loading strategy | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero/cover | Best approved couple portrait or hero from `~/Downloads/PREWED EDIT` | Landscape or portrait depending on source | Keep faces in safe center; preserve editorial negative space | Mobile 900px wide; desktop 1600px wide | AVIF/WebP + JPEG fallback | Preload only hero LCP | Existing configured hero image |
| Bride & groom — groom | Best individual groom portrait selected after complete asset review | Portrait | Head/shoulders with eyes in upper third | 900×1200 | AVIF/WebP | Lazy-load below fold | Existing groom asset, documented for replacement |
| Bride & groom — bride | Existing approved bride portrait after review | Portrait | Preserve face and dress detail | 900×1200 | AVIF/WebP | Lazy-load | Existing configured bride image |
| Love story | Only approved supporting couple image | Mixed | Crop to preserve subjects, avoid decorative faces being cut | 1200px long edge | WebP/AVIF | Lazy-load | Botanical divider/no image |
| Gallery | Curated existing/prewed images | Mixed | Explicit focal point per image; reserve aspect ratio | 900–1600px long edge | AVIF/WebP | Lazy-load, low-priority | Existing gallery item |
| Event details | Optional venue image only if approved | Landscape | Wide crop with clear venue context | 1200×800 | WebP/AVIF | Lazy-load | Text-only event panel |
| Closing | Optional final couple image | Portrait/landscape | Calm, low-detail crop | 1200px long edge | WebP/AVIF | Lazy-load | Botanical engraving |
| QRIS | Existing QRIS asset | Square | No crop; preserve quiet zone | Exact scan-safe dimensions | PNG/WebP only if scan-tested | Load when gift section is near viewport | Text gift details |

### Groom portrait review status

A complete file listing of `~/Downloads/PREWED EDIT` could not be safely completed during the planning run because the path currently resolves through a symlink loop on this server. No asset was copied, deleted, or selected by assumption. Before P1 implementation, resolve that path and review every image; choose the best individual portrait based on sharpness, face visibility, neutral crop space, and consistency with the Vintage Garden direction. Keep the current configured portrait as a temporary fallback and document the replacement decision.

## Incremental migration strategy

1. Freeze a baseline commit and keep the existing backup branch.
2. Land only `design-system/` documentation first for approval.
3. Implement P0 global tokens and typography behind existing component boundaries; do not change data contracts.
4. Implement the cover/opening as the first vertical slice and verify guest personalization/audio/open state.
5. Migrate one P1 chapter at a time, retaining old markup until the replacement passes responsive and accessibility checks.
6. Migrate P2 interactive surfaces last; treat RSVP, wishes, gifts, QRIS, maps, and admin as protected behavior.
7. Optimize only after visual parity and functional regression checks; never delete an asset before usage search confirms it is unused.
8. Maintain a migration checklist and screenshot baseline for every breakpoint.
9. Require explicit approval before changing source photos, removing decorative assets, changing font families, or altering motion intensity.
10. Run type-check, production build, browser smoke tests, Lighthouse, and a final git diff review before merge.

## Required approval decisions before implementation

- Final editorial serif and Arabic font pairing.
- Exact hero and groom portrait assets after the symlink-loop path is resolved.
- Whether existing watercolor assets are reduced, retained as fallback, or removed after usage confirmation.
- Whether the opening interaction remains a full cover or becomes a shorter chapter reveal.
- Accepted mobile performance exceptions, if any.
